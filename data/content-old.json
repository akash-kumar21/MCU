    "content": [
      "There was an idea to bring together a group of remarkable people... three spidermen! The lineup for MCU's to-be-titled Spider-Man 3 is looking CRAZY. Jamie Foxx is returning as Electro, Doctor Strange will be included, and now Tobey Macguire and Andrew Garfield are rumored to reprise their roles as Spider-Man in the MCU, joining current Spider-Man Tom Holland.",
      "Fans have been pleading for a live-action Spider-Verse for years, and it now it may finally happen. I think it would be really cool, and it could work really well with the narrative since Doctor Strange could bring Tobey Macguire and Andrew Garfield in using his magical powers.",
      "That said, I am actually not a huge fan of the idea of Doctor Strange being in the film since I’ve heard his purpose is to act as a sort of mentor for Spider-Man in the way that Iron Man was prior. I think it’s time for Spider-Man to grow out of this need for a mentor, and perhaps even take on a larger role on the Avengers."

      "From WandaVision's trailer, we know that Scarlet Witch is living inside an alternate reality bubble where Vision is still alive, but it looks like the prospect of Marvel multiverse is growing (not to mention the rumors of a Spider-Verse). It is now rumored, by Serlent Pops, that Quicksilver, Wanda's brother will be making an appearance in the much anticipated Disney+ show.",
      "Wandavision has everyone guessing as to the premise of the show. From what we’ve seen so far it appears to mirror some aspects of the Truman Show movie. Wanda and Vision are living a happy suburban life till they begin to notice that not everything seems quite normal as it may appear.",
      "In a nod to the comics, Wanda and Vision also have twin boys named Wiccan and Speed who later join the superhero group of the Young Avengers. Could Disney+ be setting up for yet another TV show?"

The show got a 3-second teaser during the Super Bowl that didn’t give too much away but got fans wanting more. Tom Hiddleston promises that we get to know what he does with the Space Stone after his surprise disappearance at the end of Avengers: Endgame. And Kevin Feige has confirmed that the show connects to the upcoming movie, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. Some leaked photos from shooting also hint at the possibility of a Lady Loki played by Sophia Di Martino.",

What we do know however is that, thanks to the popularity of Loki, a Season 2 has already been commissioned -- even before finishing filming on Season 1. As Loki himself said, “There are no men like me.”"
